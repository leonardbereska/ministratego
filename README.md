# Mini Stratego
Build a mini stratego AI

Ideas

datasets: how big should it be?
- [ ] initial setups random-agents 
- [ ] complete games random-agents 
- [ ] smart agents datasets?: e.g. minmax omniscient to construct 

initial setup:
- [ ] learn classifier for good setups
- [ ] evolutionary algorithm 
- [ ] data analysis over setups, length of game, randomness, dependence on initial setup

agent:
- [ ] simple-reflex agent
- [ ] monte-carlo agent
- [ ] heuristic agent: learn heuristic with game dataset e.g. smart feature weights or convolutional value network
- [ ] minmax omniscient agent 
- [ ] reinforcement or otherly learned agent with dataset from played games of (not too dump AI)
