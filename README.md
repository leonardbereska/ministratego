# Mini Stratego
Build a mini stratego AI

Ideas

initial setup:
- [ ] construct dataset -> learn classifier for good setups
- [ ] evolutionary algorithm for finding best initial setup
- [ ] data analysis over setups, length of game, randomness, dependence on initial

agent:
- [ ] simple-reflex agent
- [ ] monte-carlo agent
- [ ] heuristic agent
- [ ] minmax omniscient agent
- [ ] reinforcement or otherly learned agent with dataset from played games of (not too dump AI)
